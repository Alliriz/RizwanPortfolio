* Created a tool to estimate data science salary to a range of values, which may help in negotiating contracts
* Used a dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data)
* Explored and cleaned data using pandas, numpy
* Engineered features from given text used in multiple choice questions present in the data
* Performed feature selection using recursive feature elimination techniques
* Implemented and optimized via GridSearchCv a classification algorithm using logistic regression.

## Code and Resources Used
Python Version: 3.7<br>
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

## Data Cleaning
* Identify and convert datatypes
* Parse numeric data out of salary ranges
