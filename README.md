# Rizwan Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio. I am an aspiring data scientist with a background in engineering. I work with any interesting data sources I find and try to learn from them as much as I can.

# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Predictor](https://github.com/Alliriz/Rizwan_Portfolio/tree/main/Salary)
* Created a tool to estimate data science salary to a range of values, which may help in negotiating contracts
* Used a dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data)
* Explored and cleaned data using pandas, numpy
* Engineered features from given text used in multiple choice questions present in the data
* Performed feature selection using recursive feature elimination techniques
* Implemented and optimized via GridSearchCv a classification algorithm using logistic regression.

# [Project 2: Canadian Election via Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Alliriz/Rizwan_Portfolio/tree/main/SentimentAnalysis)
* Produced insights on the 2019 Canadian Elections using Twitter Data
* Performed Data cleaning pandas and regular expressions
* Sorted different political parties into bins for further analysis
* Explored data via visualizaiton using ggplot, wordcloud and seaborn
* Used NLP techniques to convert text data into a machine readable format
* Implement and Optimize multiple classification algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.

# [Project 3: Salary Estimator](https://github.com/Alliriz/Rizwan_Portfolio/tree/main/Levels)
* Used a dataset acquired from [Levels](https://www.levels.fyi/)
* Used Scala and SQL to explore and clean dataset
* Engineered and limited features to counteract against a high feature-space
* Incorporated the use of feature importance via Random Forests to select features
* Implemented and optimized via GridSearchCV various Regression Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Tree estimators and ensembles.
* Evaluated predicted results using various metrics such as MSE, SMAPE, etc.
